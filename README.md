# Crystal_Night_Light
Particle Photon powered crystal nightlight featureing 3D printed "Quartz Crystal'

Inspired by Thingiverse.com creation by Forehead: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1598283

Uses NeoCandle code by Tim Bartlett: https://github.com/timpear/NeoCandle

I'm using this for a nitelight in my daughter's bedroom, it automatically turns on at sunset and off at whatever time you want it to.

The files for the grey 3D printed base are enclosed.

Have fun and let me know if you can make any improvements to the code!
